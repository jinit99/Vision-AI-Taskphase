Task-2 Update: Completed the task 2 and learnt various libraries and their implementation like numpy pandas sklearn and matplotlib. Also learned the opencv code implementation and code working and updated all the files in the folder

Task-3 : In this specialization i have learnt 5 various courses like neural network and deep learning, Improving Deep meural network, Structuring Machine learning projects, Convolutional neural networks, and Sequence models and have applied various concepts in the form of labs and assignments.
also in this got to know how to code train test and experiment various machine learning problems and increase its accuracy.
